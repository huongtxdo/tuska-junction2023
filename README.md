# ChroniConnect

This is a solution for the [Junction 2023](https://www.junction2023.com/)
Tietoevry challenge
[#PainMgmt](https://www.junction2023.com/challenges-2023/tietoevry) by Team Tuska.

People experiencing chronic pain feel excluded from society, because they don't
have access to people going through similar experiences. Our application will
create groups of similar people with medical professional supervision, provide
positive individual reinforcement, and reduce opioid usage. In addition, the app
allows tracking of pain and medicine dosage daily, so the patient can easily
track their progress.

The app is publicly available at https://chroniconnect.vercel.app/

It is a SPA made with React + Material UI + TypeScript, bundled with Vite and
deployed to Firebase.
